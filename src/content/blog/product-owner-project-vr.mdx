description: Overview of my role as a Product Owner on Project VR
---

**NOTE : This is a work in progress article, published for a presentation.**

During the 3rd year of my studies at SAE Institute, we were tasked to work on two Unreal Engine 5 games that would be done in collaboration with the Audio and Game Art sections.
This is called the Specialisation Projects, since for the other sections it's the occasion to specialise themselves in their field.
As for the programmers, we mostly did any tasks that had to be done for the games.

In this blog post, I will present the work I did as a product owner on one of these games : Project VR.

## Table of Contents

## Context

Project VR is a VR game (who would have guessed !) that is inspired by escape games.
You start in an office with a dead body on the floor and you have to get out of the room and solve the mystery at the same time.

The idea of this game was first brain stormed during the 2023 summer break.
Then in September, we reworked the game design until October.
A Vertical Slice of the game is due to release on February the 9th along with this blog post.

I also did the "DevOps" on this project (see my [blog post](./devops-specialisation-projects)) and a bit of programming.
Although I couldn't do as much as I wanted to, since my laptop died during the production of the game.

## Global Organisation

TODO
