description: Presentation of how I set up the self-hosted tools that we used in the production of the two games we made for the specialisation projects.

**NOTE : This is a work in progress article, published for a presentation.**

During the 3rd year of my studies at SAE Institute, we were tasked to work on two Unreal Engine 5 games that would be done in collaboration with the Audio and Game Art sections.
This is called the Specialisation Projects, since for the other sections it's the occasion to specialise themselves in their field.
As for the programmers, we mostly did any tasks that had to be done for the games.

In this blog post, I will present the work I did to setup part of the production pipeline, specifically the self-hosted tools.

## DevOps ?

What I will talk about in this blog post is not really DevOps, it's more about the tools I setup in my home server for the production of the Specialisation Projects.
It's just the name we gave to this task, even though it doesn't fit the real definition of DevOps.
