description: Presentation of how I set up the self-hosted tools that we used in the production of the two games we made for the specialisation projects.

**NOTE : This is a work in progress article, published for a presentation.**

During the 3rd year of my studies at SAE Institute, we were tasked to work on two Unreal Engine 5 games that would be done in collaboration with the Audio and Game Art sections.
This is called the Specialisation Projects, since for the other sections it's the occasion to specialise themselves in their field.
As for the programmers, we mostly did any tasks that had to be done for the games.

In this blog post, I will present the work I did to setup part of the production pipeline, specifically the self-hosted tools.

## DevOps ?

What I will talk about in this blog post is not really DevOps, it's more about the tools I setup in my home server for the production of the Specialisation Projects.
It's just the name we gave to this task, even though it doesn't fit the real definition of DevOps.

## The Server

TODO : PICTURE OF COMPUTER

For these projects, we (the students) are usually supposed to host the tools on a server that's inside the school.
But unfortunately, when we started the projects, the WiFi at school wasn't working, so we couldn't do that.
So that we weren't stuck, I decided that we could instead host everything on my old gaming computer at home.
But since it was supposed to be a temporary solution, I though it would be faster to set up a GitLab instance, instead of Perforce.
We were also supposed to use [Jira](https://www.atlassian.com/fr/software/jira), but we didn't know if we could get a license, and if we could get it working on my server.
So we also decided to use an alternative : [Trello](https://trello.com/).

The first thing I needed was to install Linux on my machine.
I knew that [Ubuntu Server](https://ubuntu.com/download/server) was a pretty wiedly used distribution for home servers, so I tried to install it.
But it kept failling with a Python exception I think related to an old partition name in of the drives of the computer, even though I wiped it beforehand.

After trying multiple times, I gave up Ubuntu Server, and decided to try [Debian](https://www.debian.org/).
Fortunately, it immediately worked, and I had a Linux installation working !

I was then able to install a few packages, so that I could use `sudo` and `ssh`.

Debian comes with an Apache install, and I wanted to check that port forwarding was working with it.
I already had a domain name, so I hit one bird with two stones and directly put my computer's IP in my registrar after opening my port and checked if it was working.

But here comes the start of the problems : my ISP, Salt, does not provide a public IPv4, which means that we couldn't access the server
